### Parse fixed width file

- Generate a fixed width file using the provided spec (offset provided in the spec file represent the length of each field).
- Implement a parser that can parse the fixed width file and generate a delimited file, like CSV for example.
- DO NOT use python libraries like pandas for parsing. You can use the standard library to write out a csv file (If you feel like)
- Language choices (Python or Scala)
- Deliver source via github or bitbucket
- Bonus points if you deliver a docker container (Dockerfile) that can be used to run the code (too lazy to install stuff that you might use)
- Pay attention to encoding
